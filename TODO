first to register app == owner

anyone (with an account on the pod) can create cells

owner can grant read permissions to environments to other users
if they don't have an account, send an email
email should link to auto-generated install script with invite code

for invites to existing users maybe email, but no action required

can't list apps

can list users who have read access on app/env



hash the .spore file and store it in version control
- show all environments in one file
- show all keys, hash the values (uid (3-4 characters?))
- should every key have a value for every environment (even if the value is null)?

~/.spore/apps/:app_id/:env_name/:id ?
~/.spore/apps/:app_id/:env_name ?
~/.spore/apps/:app_id ?

make spore work without a central server
- can share .spore directory with anyone and they get access to the same stuff that you do
- that way, can keep the actual server itself closed source
- can the .spore directory work as a pseudo central server for local development? sync with the server later?
  - would require uuid instead of small (3-4 character) ids
- maybe open source the server too - try to drive adoption
- call the server spore-pod
  - hosted version free for up to 5 users
  - $50/month for a team of up to 10
  - $200/month for a team of up to 20
  - $10/user/month after that?
- is it still valuable without the central server?

separate read/write access
- all devs get write access on everything (writing == creating new hash)
- only certain devs get read access on everything
- get read access on hashes in certain environments (i.e. development)

use a centralized cache
- remove `download`
- directory with hashes, and their corresponding values as their contents
- fallback to cache if no download available
- have a version of `run` that doesn't save to a cache (for production/staging)

have settings in the central cache
- which host/port/protocol to use by default
- default environment
- name of the file in local directories (i.e. .spore)
- netrc file to use

have `set` be a prompt
- don't put the value in the shell itself, put it through stdin
- have a special `setall` to set a value on all of the environments


have a special api key for each environment that only maps to that environment (i.e. you don't need to specify the environment)

migrate
- heroku (set spore key on heroku server)
  - how to distinguish production and staging?
- dotenv

install script
- curl install.spore.sh | sh
  - should make sure npm is installed: `curl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh`
