hash the .spore file and store it in version control
- show all environments in one file
- show all keys, hash the values (uid (3-4 characters?))
- should every key have a value for every environment (even if the value is null)?

~/.spore/:app_id/:env_name/:id ?
~/.spore/:app_id/:env_name ?
~/.spore/:app_id ?

- should the same keys in different environments in the same app have the same hash?
- should the same keys in different environments in different apps have the same hash?
- probably not - defeats the purpose of separating them out

make spore work without a central server
- can share .spore file with anyone and they get access to the same stuff that you do
- that way, can keep the actual server itself closed source
- can the .spore directory work as a pseudo central server for local development? sync with the server later?
  - would require uuid instead of small (3-4 character) ids
    - can get down to 10 characters (64 bits with Z85) if you're willing to accept p=10^-15 after 190 hashes (p=10^-12 after 6100 hashes)
    - `crypto.randomBytes(8)`
    - 15 characters (96 bits) would provide p=10^-15 after 13m hashes
    - 20 characters => 820b hashes
- maybe open source the server too - try to drive adoption
- call the server spore-pod
  - hosted version free for up to 5 users
  - $50/month for a team of up to 10
  - $200/month for a team of up to 20
  - $10/user/month after that?
- is it still valuable without the central server?

separate read/write access
- all devs get write access on everything (writing == creating new hash)
- only certain devs get read access on everything
- get read access on hashes in certain environments (i.e. development)

use a centralized cache
- remove `download`
- directory with hashes, and their corresponding values as their contents
- fallback to cache if no download available
- have a version of `run` that doesn't save to a cache (for production/staging)

have settings in the central cache
- which host/port/protocol to use by default
- default environment
- name of the file in local directories (i.e. .spore)
- netrc file to use

have `set` be a prompt
- don't put the value in the shell itself, put it through stdin
- have a special `setall` to set a value on all of the environments

migrate
- heroku (set spore key on heroku server)
  - how to distinguish production and staging?
- dotenv

install script
- curl install.spore.sh | sh
  - should make sure npm is installed: `curl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh`
